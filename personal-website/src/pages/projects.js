            Here is a list of projects I worked on in the past years, or I am currently working on.
            Currently all projects shown were worked on as part of university projects, Those before 2021 are from the Bachelor Semester Projects (BSP) of the Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Luxembourg.

          Hunger Slayer: Grand Banquet was developed as the main deliverable of the Virtual Reality course in the Computer Science Master at EPFL.
          The objective with this project was to implement various interaction techniques of VR applications in a fun environment.
          The game was created with the assistance of Paul Oliver and No√© De Santo and was selected as a honorable mention for best game of the year.

            Forest SaVR 0.1 is developed as the first part of a multi-semester project for the Bachelor in Computer Science of the University of Luxembourg.
            This project is made as part of the <a href="https://vrarlab.uni.lu/">VR/AR LAB</a> with Jean Botev and is developed with <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faUnity}/></a>.
            Forest SaVR received the <b>best demo/poster award</b> at the 2020 GI VR/AR Workshop in Trier, Germany.
            A newer version is in development, as part of BSP5 and BSP6, and our objective is to transform it into a playable, enjoyable, and educative serious game. <br/>
            - Version showed was made in 2019, as part of BSP3.

            The objective was to make an interactive, enjoyable, and understandable learning experience for students starting discrete mathematics.
                The philosophy behind this project was that students learn better when they are in an enjoyable environment,
                so instead of discovering how to write proofs through a simple pdf,
                they could read the lesson, and solve simple exercises in a responsive (and beautiful) website. <br/>
                - Made in 2019, as part of BSP2.

          id={"bsp1"} media={<img src={bsp1} className="img-fluid my-3" alt="Screenshot of the visual user interface"/>}>
            The objective was to create a visual user interface, available as a locally hosted website,
            for a more user-friendly version of an automatic concept recognition tool which annotates legal documents.
            This interface allows users to upload their own documents, annotate them with the tool and see the recognized concepts as categorized tooltips. <br/>

            - Made in 2018, as part of BSP1
