        <b>Abstract:</b><br/>
        3D displays are becoming available to mainstream consumers, offering the ability to view and interact with 3D content without wearing AR/VR glasses.
        This paper reports the findings of a user study that compares the performance of a range of different input devices for 3D creation tasks on a 3D display.
        The first-time use performance of a mouse, a tracked 6DoF controller, and a pen on a graphics tablet (without display) are evaluated in an office setting for a series of 3D sketching, painting and docking tasks.
        The main finding is that the three input modalities provide similar levels of precision, but for 3D sketching and docking, the 6DoF controller has significantly shorter execution times, fewer interactions, and is more enjoyable than other devices, at the cost of increased fatigue.
        For surface painting and regular UI interaction, the mouse is more accurate, without any speed differences.
        Many participants reported the graphics tablet pen as being confusing or frustrating to use, frequently resulting in longer task times and more errors.

        <b>Abstract:</b><br/>
        Pressure sensitive inputs are an important feature for many XR design and creativity applications.
        This is typically accomplished using the trigger input on the default platform 6DoF controller.
        This paper reports the findings of a pilot user study that compares the performance of the default platform 6DoF controller trigger with an isometric force sensor integrated into the barrel of a prototype stylus device.
        The force sensor on the prototype stylus is activated with either the thumb or the index finger.
        The result of the 12-person pilot study shows that mean throughput of stylus index finger interactions is higher than the stylus thumb usage and default controller trigger usage;
        These differences were not statistically significant, showcasing that both stylus inputs have no major disadvantage compared to the standard that is the controller.
        Subjectively, stylus index finger pressure control was the preferred interaction technique for most participants.

          <b>Abstract:</b><br/>
          Studies of cybersickness (CS) often require a significant investment in creating the primary VR environment and other experiment-related features.
          In addition, minor differences in VR content in independent studies may lead to opposite results.
          This motivates us to introduce a standardized CS assessment framework to facilitate the development of CS-related experiments.
          This paper describes the concept of the framework, the current progress of the technical implementation, and future goals.
